# The Machine
<i>We are being watched...</i>
<p>One of the first words ever heard on this show. So simple, but yet, it invokes a sense of wonder and excitement to the viewer. This program, while it will probably never be as advanced as the life created by Harold, is a simulation of <a href="http://personofinterest.wikia.com/wiki/The_Machine">The Machine</a> from the show Person of Interest. 

For those of you who do not know anything about The Machine, which seems very unlikely since you're at a Person of Interest java program, The Machine is an AI who was created to monitor the people of the US after 9/11, it is used to predict terrorist attacks from webcam monitors, security cameras, phone microphones, email, computers, and anything digital. 

This idea was originally done by some redditors on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/themachineproject">the machine subreddit</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/poi-the-machine/the-machine">GitHub</a> repository. The group for an amount of time stopped working on it so I decided to follow in their footsteps. These projects have no affiliation between them, they are separate projects both based off of a great TV show.

The Machine soon will run on kperating systems besides Windows and maybe it will eventually work on Android.

So far only the access to the webcam has been coded but facial recognition is in the works.

There is no download link yet since it is only a webcam app but once other features are added it will be published.

TL;DR The Machine lives
