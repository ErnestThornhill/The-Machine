EDIT: They came back since this was made, but stopped again. I stopped too, but it is something I still hope to work on in the future!

# The Machine
<i>We are being watched...</i>
<p>One of the first words ever heard on this show. So simple, but yet, it invokes a sense of wonder and excitement to the viewer. This program, while it will probably never be as advanced as the life created by Harold, is a simulation of <a href="http://personofinterest.wikia.com/wiki/The_Machine">The Machine</a> from the show Person of Interest. 

For those of you who do not know anything about The Machine, which seems very unlikely since you're at a Person of Interest java program, The Machine is an AI who was created to monitor the people of the US after 9/11, it is used to predict terrorist attacks from webcam monitors, security cameras, phone microphones, email, computers, and anything digital. 

This idea was originally done by some redditors on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/themachineproject">the machine subreddit</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/the-machine-project/the-machine">GitHub</a> repository. The group for an amount of time stopped working on it so I decided to follow in their footsteps. These projects have no affiliation between them, they are separate projects both based off of a great TV show.

The Machine soon will run on computer operating systems, so far only Windows has been tested, and maybe it will eventually work on Android. Facial Detection has been created and future plans are in the works. There is no download link yet since I have not found a web host yet for the files but as soon as I do, the link will be accessible from this page.

TL;DR The Machine lives

P.S. When the Jar file is closed, a process is left running, so far I have not found how to stop this from happening and it is something I will be working towards in the future to fix. The process is Java(TM) SE Binary and can be closed in task manager in the section, Background Processes.
